The Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher, is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques.
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
How It Works
       Shift Value: Decide on a shift value (key). For example, a shift of 3 means that A becomes D, B becomes E, etc.
       Encryption: Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
       Decryption: To decrypt, shift the letters back by the same number of positions.
